# micro-panel

**WIP: the whole thing is being rewritten from scratch**

micro-panel is a set of Web Components for editing IndieWeb sites.

micro-panel is a part of [Sweetroll](https://github.com/myfreeweb/sweetroll), but it's usable as a completely independent tool.
It just likes engines that put *everything* into Microformats2 objects :)

Also check out [indieweb-components](https://github.com/myfreeweb/indieweb-components) for some small components to enhance your website.
